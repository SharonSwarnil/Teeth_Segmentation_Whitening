# Teeth Segmentation & Whitening (Assignment Problem 1)

This project builds a pipeline for **teeth detection/segmentation** from face images and a **bonus whitening filter**.  
It uses **DeepLabV3 with MobileNetV2 backbone** for lightweight, near real-time segmentation.

## Features
- JSON â†’ binary mask preprocessing (supports LabelMe-style annotations).
- Training with Dice loss for segmentation accuracy.
- Inference with overlay + mask output.
- Bonus: whitening filter applied to predicted teeth masks.
- Model quantization support for faster CPU/GPU inference.
- Reproducibility instructions + requirements.txt.
