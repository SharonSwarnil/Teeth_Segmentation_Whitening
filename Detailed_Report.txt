##  Final Report 

Sections:

### 1. Solution Approach
- **Attempted methods**: tried raw resize vs proper JSON parsing, dummy masks vs polygon masks.  
- **Final chosen approach**: DeepLabV3 (MobileNetV2 backbone), Dice loss, JSON→mask preprocessing.  
- **Post-processing**: Whitening filter applied using mask overlay.  

### 2. Preprocessing
- Resize all images & masks to fixed size (e.g., 512×512).  
- Convert JSON polygons into binary masks (LabelMe → cv2.fillPoly).  

### 3. Model
- DeepLabV3 + MobileNetV2 (lightweight, near real-time).  
  
### 4. Training
- Optimizer: Adam, LR=1e-3.  
- Loss: DiceLoss.  
- Epochs: 10 (Dice improving steadily → best=1.0).  

### 5. Evaluation
- Metric: Dice coefficient.  
- Achieved Dice = **1.0 on validation** (caution: small dataset may inflate results).  

### 6. Future Improvements
- Add **data augmentation** (rotation, brightness, mouth-open vs closed).  
- Multi-class (teeth vs gums vs lips) to improve whitening precision.  
- Distillation for mobile deployment.    
- Quantized version available for deployment (For fast loading).
- Train with larger dataset for robustness.
- Lighter models (EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNetV3).
- Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces for free public demo.
- Explore GAN-based whitening.

##7 Note - Training data best outcome saved in "Checkpoint/best_model.path".
